	                between the packages.

------------------- Former file ChangeLog.TMT -------------------
The changes documented since 3/2002, which is the date stated in Brian's 
version of the Description file.

  In Sept 2012 the current R version and the Mayo version were merged.

14March02: When y was a factor, with no instances of one of the levels in
the "middle" of the levels list, the program would generate NA due to
division by 0.  Fairly simple fixes to gini.c and rpart.s.  The bug, and
a very nicely documented test case, was supplied by Matthew Wiener.

8Aug02: Small bug pointed out by Kai Yu in rundown.c - a missing pair of {},
which only apply if usesurrogate < 2 and there are lots of missings.  Appears
that the se of the xval error would be too small.

29Oct02: Error in xpred.rpart.s, for a user split with a response vector >1,
the "yback" vector was too short.  (Diff the lines creating eframe with those
of rpart.s, to see the obvious oversight!)  Leads to a core dump.

29Oct02: Fix error in branch.c, which was not watching out for missing
values in the surrogate variable.  Found due to close reading of the
C code by Kai Yu.  (I'm impressed!)

12Nov02: Add the "return.all" argument to xpred.rpart, to fit the needs of
Dan Schaid.  Add the test case xpred.s to test it.

28Nov02: Major changes to how indexing is done.  In the older version, at a 
lower branch on the tree one would find the following code again and again:
	for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
	    if (which[i] = current_node) {
		 ... all the work ...
	        }
If a node only had 20 of n=20,000 observations in it, the code still walked
through all 20000.  
   In the new code, the chain of routines is called with the pair
(n1, n2).  Consequences:

   a. The repeated code fragment is now the much more efficient
			for (i=n1; i<n2; i++) {
A trivial test (continuous y, n=20000, 20 xvals, cp=0 to force deep trees)
gave unix.time values of 107 vs 2526 seconds.  This was a bit of a shock -
I never assumed that quite so much of the time could be spent in
inefficient bookkeeping.  With shallower trees I would expect far less
gain, maybe 2 fold (at n=2000 it was 10 vs 32 seconds).
   b. In nodesplit.c, extra work has to be done to modify the rp.sort
array.  See comments in the last block of nodesplit for a full
explanation.
   c. Under the new regime, it turns out to be important to NOT sort
the columns of the x matrix.  As a consequence:
	1. There is no advantage to calling rpart with as.single(x) to
	  save memory.  The copy=F arg is a more efficient use of
	  resources.  (If the S manuals can be believed....)
        2. Internal variables have been changed to 'double', by redefining
	  the constant "FLOAT" in rpart.h.
	3. Since X is not disturbed, it is now safe to use the is_na
	macro to test it, rather than passing the result of is.na(X) as
        a separate argument to the C code.  This resulted in further
	algorithmic time savings in nodesplit.c and branch.c (depending on
	the number of surrogates that need to be used in splitting).
   d. Because tree building mixes up the rp.sorts array, we need to save
an original copy for cross-validation.  So the rewrite is not a total win --
we use somewhat more memory.  Subsetting out a group of subjects
turns out to be essentially the same code as was added to nodesplit.

29Nov02: If the primary split sends exactly the same number left and right
(same total weights actually), there should be no "go with the majority"
default.  Prior code always would choose left in this case, now chooses
neither.

29Nov02: The length of the response vector (numresp) added to the output
structure.  It was needed for xpred.rpart.

2Dec02: Based on concerns of a user (whose email I currently can't find) about
accuracy with asymmetric loss matrices, I spent the last 2 days creating
a completely worked example.  Their concerns, unfortunately, were completely
justified.
   a. With L=loss asymmetric, the altered priors were computed wrong -- they
were using L' instead of L!  Upshot -- the tree would not not necessarily
choose optimal splits for the given loss matrix.  Once chosen, splits were 
evaluated correctly.  The printed "improvement" values are of course the
wrong onese as well.  It's interesting that for my little test case, with
L quite asymmetric, the early splits in the tree are unchanged -- a good split
still looks good.  Simple fix to gini.c.
   b. Fixed a minor bug in the Gini criteria -- the printed "improvement"
values were too large by a constant = (#classes -1).  Since they are only used
to select the largest value, there was no practical impact.

17Jun05: Fix offset bug -- the line in rpart.s didn't actually get
the offset, but rather the variable number of the offset.
 
27March05: Finish up the test suite for priors.  Run test suite.  Code is
ready for distribution.
